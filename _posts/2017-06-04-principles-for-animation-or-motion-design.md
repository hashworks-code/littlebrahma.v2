Since the growth of digital era, Animation has gained a wide popularity with the use of motion design in the media. What makes the motion design so captivating and popular is that it conveys the idea or a thought more appealing and sensible way a human can understand. Motion design can convey a process or an idea much more effectively than a still image. In the previous century, the animation was a thing which was a trade known to a few. But now with the emergence of digital trends, nowadays it accessible for who ever want to create an experience.

To do an animation is easy. You have to know the tool or the old paper and pencil way. But knowing the tool isn't the end. Becoming the master of a tool doesn't make you the master of the art. Here are the 12 basic principles of motion which make an animation lively regardless of the theme


**1. Squash and Stretch**

This property gives the animated object a sense of weight and volume. When an object is in uninterrupted continuous motion, it is represented by stretch and when it is interrupted squash takes over. This property makes the object more relatable to our surroundings

Eg: A bouncing ball

**2. Anticipation**

This property prepares the audience or viewers about an important action the object is going to perform. This creates specialized pre-actions related to the main action that is going to happen.
This helps to create a sense of organic feel to the animation
Eg: A man going to jump(main action) squashes to the ground(Anticipation)

**3. Staging**

Staging is the way to present an object or an idea so that it is clear to the viewers. Staging involves some of the design aspects such as rule of thirds, golden ratio etc.

**4. Straight ahead and Pose to Pose**

Rather than a law, these two are two ways to animate. Straight ahead deals with the creation of animation frame after frame while pose to pose creates the key points first and then filling in the voids with frames.

**5. Slow in and Slow out**

In the physical world, all the object moves at a constant acceleration and deceleration. If you hand has to move up and touch your head, then your hand has to accelerate the first half and decelerate the next half. And it reaches the maximum velocity at the middle of the journey.

**6. Arc**

All the objects around us move in the trajectory of an arc. From the great solar system to a mere finger movement. The reason for that occurrence may vary like, in the case of the solar system it's the gravity and in the case of fingers it's the joints.




**7. Secondary Action**

Secondary actions are the movements which complement the primary action of a subject. For example, if you see a man walking, it is the primary action. But the swinging of hands is secondary. For a flying bird movement of wings can be primary but the movement of the feather are secondary. In short secondary action provides more impact to the primary action.


**8. Timing**

Using timing you can communicate a wide variety of properties of the object. It can define the character, personality, Emotions etc. Timing as the name implies is basically the sense of usage of time which can be very powerful to create certain scenarios.

These are some of the main laws that you can master and it will help you get started to create more sensible animation or motion design. These aren't the laws written on rocks. You can experiment with these and improve your skills.  And remember one thing. Keep your eyes open. The whole world around you is filled with these wonders of motion.

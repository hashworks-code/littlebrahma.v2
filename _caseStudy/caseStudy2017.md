cHead1: "The story of Brahma "

cContent1: " We related our idea of creation to Brahma an Indian mythical god. He is an omnipresent and attributed to every creation on earth. Inspired with this thought, our 2017 calendar was published narrating his origin stories."

cImg2: "group"

cHead2: "Finding the right balance:"

cContent2: "The focus was to bring the right balance of story telling and contemporary design to the illustrations. Images of young lord brahma and his introduction to the new world realities."

cHead3: "Our visual narration"

cContent3: "Taking a queue from the old, we chose to stick with vibrant colors and traditional symbolism. We gave a contemporary touch to the illustration by creating characters with less detailing. We played with eye and mouth expression to display emotions and used supporting elements to showcase movements and drama. This gave a comic feel to the entire visualization."

cImg3: "group-3"

cHead4: "Highlighting civic and social knick knacks:"

cContent4: " With a growing population we wanted to highlight the civil issues afflicting the country. 
            With the various festivals as the backdrop, carelessness in public property, vandalism,
              pain of saree shopping were some of the tongue in cheek examples that we have tried to showcase with subtlety."

cHead5: "Bringing old stories into the pop culture:"

cContent5: "Little brahma as a brand takes inspiration from the creative storytelling and symbolism that is deep rooted 
in our culture and heritage from time immemorial. This can be seen in the architecture and artifacts left behind by our ancestors and forefathers for eons.  As Brahma is the god of creation, we took inspiration from this to create 
the little brahma calendar."

cHead6: "Brahma and art:"

cContent6: " We narrated different stories of lord Brahma in the calendar pages. To bring these stories to life in the current era and add relevance to it, we interplayed it with subtle humor on the illustration while still keeping the stories close to the original."

cHead7: "Representation of facts:"

cContent7: " We captured the eminent stories of Brahma with clear facts. We showcased origin stories of Brahma which many have not heard off. Visually, we used new world elements to showcase old world facts in the illustrations. Usage of desk with mirrors an example of the neo-modern approach of our visual narration of facts."

cHead5: "Adapt "
csubHead4: "Designing the digital journey of an order"
cContent9: "Our design wireframe helped us establish a platform for us to go back & forth on the visual ideas with our users. We worked on multiple approaches for visual representations to crack the optimal design"
csubHead5: "Output"
cContent10: "We were able to come up with following solutions for our customers."


cHead6: "1.  Compact & efficient search functionality"
cContent11: "Categorization of the search modules based on a regular search, Workflow search and Distress order search with a simple dropdown model. This categorization with the added smart multi-search capability makes finding an order a breeze."

cHead7: "2. Short story of an entire order flow "
cContent12: "Entire flow of an order from booking to dispatching in a slider tray format gave a clear insight on the order journey, to help order prediction. The ability to navigate to the hold and workflow actions from respective orders irrespective of single or tie order reduces the amount of clicks to remediate a hiccup on the flow."

cHead8: "3.  Information abstracted in schematic form"
cContent13: "Insights and reports visualised in efficient graphic representation. Viewing the data by region and country wise distribution helps the decision making faster for sales."

cHead9: "4.  Smart sorting of data"
cContent14: "Interactive sorting of the search result data makes the decision makers focus on actionable items rather than wasting time on horizontal scrolling across the 144 columns to perform an action. Smart grouping of filters based on user context decreased the latency to take an action on an issue from 50 sec to 23 sec."


cHead10: "5.  Design"
cContent15: "Designing a data heavy platform with a global teams as users come with a lot of restrictions. But the Adapt stage of our process along with the atomic design method helped us to come up with a design language that fits all."

cHead11: "Evolve "
csubHead6: "Testing our efforts"
cContent16: "We carried out an extensive user testing both on the prototype and during the development phase to recheck our screen flows. Multiple iteration were done to optimize the design in consecutive sprints"

- title: 'EXPLANATORY VIDEOS'
  description: 'Mythology was explained through kathas (stories in Sanskrit). These were in various forms such as songs, dances, folk impressions and paintings. These are unrecorded, untold, unwritten histories passed on from one generation to the other. How did they survive through these centuries? That’s the beauty of human communication. It’s in the simplicity of explanation. To tell something is information lost, to explain something in a believable fashion is information gained. Our explanatory videos are made with a team of best art and sound engineers who know their characters and sets well to bring in the right cut. Having close contact with deliberation and explanation, we are making the communication strategy through videos more immersive. It is a new way of storytelling, told in a way no one has.'
- title: 'MOTION GRAPHICS'
  description: 'The illusion of motion is not just deceptive, it also is the most creative standard that meets the eye. Some might call it mirage or a natural occurrence, but nature has its own play with movement. To perfect the art of motion graphics, we take the best of tools and intellect from the motion pictures and other production formats. Our characters are hand made from repeated sketches, maquette, best gallery productions and repeatedly refined to meet the design core of your story. We tear apart all known restrictions in making motion an emotion. As we engage with a wide latitude to design what is a relevant context, graphics has better light, shadow, movement and action. Come and experience how a magnum opus is made and delivered to the big screen.'
- title: 'LOGO ANIMATION'
  description: 'The most inanimate object has a face and personality. It stems out of open discussion and debate. It must appeal to all generations and should hold its own. It should be a self-speaker without requiring any assistance. These are not just the characteristics of a logo, it is an identity. Animating that identity needs brains that understand the gravitas. These brains are called logo animation experts and we have them in full at Little Brahma. We render each move with care and caution, that way the charisma of the logo is not lost. Making the graphic interface so smooth, the logo stands out from the rest. Marking a presence with creative animation, logos are the new idols of the modern world.'
- title: 'CORPORATE VIDEOS'
  description: 'Every brand has a saga to reveal. Told in myriad styles, the saga becomes an epic over a period. It should be that way. To make one’s presence felt and revered commands respect and adoration. Showcasing that level of maturity needs the rights talents. We make your corporate video take the center stage. Armed with industry leading technical and production capabilities we are perfecting each shot and rendering it to large canvas size. It is the art of making it a perfect combination of structure and independence and requires a design thinking attitude in filmmaking which we hone constantly. The videos are getting sharper and smarter with each delivery, making the entire storyboard deserve its rightful standing ovation.'
- title: 'STOP MOTION VIDEOS'
  description: 'If the transition isn’t right, what’s the point in a movement making a grand entrance quips every choreographer. Artistic movements in dance is complete with expressions and these are best portrayed if the dancer has grace and exactness. Similar knowledge is required in stop motion videos. In every iteration, there needs to be a strong emphasis on creative flexibility. There should be symmetry and semblance. Bringing all these qualities is a rare feat. As we combine various artistic and technical disciplines to produce a stunning animation that beckons the first call in the award ceremony, we are making the red carpet more discernible. Your storyboard will be brought into life to the world’s eyes through our master craftsmen. It’s the curtain call for the grand applause.'

- title: "PACKAGE DESIGN"
  description: "The erstwhile weavers of India were known for producing such fine muslin that it invited both awe and envy from all continents. The cloth could be folded and fit neatly into a matchbox. And of course, was draped by the who’s who and took the style quotient sky high. Imagine the fine level of craftwork that went into making the threaded wonder. Now imagine getting the detail right and applying it to your product. This is how we look at package design and its survivability for generations to come. We are not just reengineering a mere package design, we are reinterpreting history. That is the level of sophistication we apply into making the layers and levels of product which apart from scoring high on visual appeal makes even the most mundane look fabulous and glamorous."
- title: "RETAIL PACKAGING"
  description: "We believe your product should deserve maximum attention from buyers and sellers alike and that is why we embed our own personal feelings, interactions, thoughts and experiences in making the retail packaging a sellout. Qualified and differentiated design are not just passive elements in our approach, rather, they serve as social and historically relevant cornerstones in making our packaging look unique and be justifiable. We also detest imitation and stereotyping and ensure the look always remains fresh and original. That way, it’s on demand both on the shelf and off the shelf. And did we mention about the rakish vibe and heads turning talents attached to it? It’s not just packaging, it is a complete package."
- title: "PRODUCT LABELS"
  description: "Being satisfied by common labeling means adopting a solution that is acceptable and not optimal, it’s the same when it comes to creating one as well. To change this understanding, we at Little Brahma look at the nimblest aspects and keep track of all developments in the world of labels to give your product the dual edge of clarity and consistency. Our design reflects a valuable diversity of opinion, philosophy and perspective while making sure your brand gets the classic charm like no other. We also build in brand confidence and oodles of cultural identity to keep the label welcomed by the young and the old. A task cut out clearly to make your product label legendary."

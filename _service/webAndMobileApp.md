- title: 'MOBILE APPS (ANDROID, IOS)'
  description: 'We believe that developing a mobile app is similar to reliving a civilization. From a single owner to maximum users, our mobile app design is resilient to handle any challenge that is thrown with force. The next stage of design is complete personalization and interaction at every level. It is a rule of thumb that focusing on front-end experience and back end operations has been no less important than now. We must also remember that today’s design should disrupt the way companies and customers interact. To make this a reality, we are creating sustainable design in every frame. It doesn’t just last longer, it becomes a heritage value.'
- title: 'WEB APPS'
  description: 'Have you seen any spider spinning the web? In the Indic tales, spiders symbolize being caught in the illusion of the physical world. Not until they have seen how the web interacts in the technology space. The power of web makes one make or break antiquity. It is only apt that we at Little Brahma are reimagining the future of the web. As we master design psychology, it is an unwritten rule that in every ideation, we create a social context that favours design dominance. Analysing how design interacts with various devices and mediums, we aim to increase creative effectiveness to make the final output complete with seamless functionality and gesture adaptability. Accelerating and harnessing digital drive is now the norm of the industry. That means, we don’t like trade offs between convenience and security and focus on offering you the best browsing experience. Web apps are becoming magically awesome here.'
- title: 'APP DEVELOPMENT'
  description: 'More can be achieved if there is meeting of minds. It is the basics of war, armies, transactions and design. Going solo is like letting go of an untamed horse into the wilderness. App development is no less. Complete integration from all stakeholders is necessary. We combine data and analytics based insights while optimizing individual touch points to streamline multiple functions and channels to make the app look strong and be strong. This is our way of solving the core of what we call as digital hypothesis. We look for novelty and applicability in the way app functions and performs when challenged with crucial stress tests. This is the hallmark of our app making culture. It’s reinforced and becomes a rule of thumb. We consider all these standards to be the starting point to make a phenomenal app. What you get after this grueling process is not a rehearsal but a final showpiece, ready for encore. '
- title: 'Dashboard design and Reporting'
  description: 'A captain has his wheel. A warrior, his weapon. A manager, his dashboard. It is the command and control center for all forms of troubleshooting that one can aspire for. Being agile and clever, a dashboard should meet the twin standards of speed and robustness. It should not just aim, but direct. Like a dart hitting bull’s eye. This calls for precision in all respects. We combine the best of scientific research and design innovations that cut across traditional discipline boundaries to make our innovation be bold. With resistance to stress, the design encompasses an integrative vision to make every nuance fit and checklist ticked. Taking the frontiers of design diffusion forward across a wide team of experts helps us gain mastery over fundamentals. Making your dashboard into a classy reporting tool with phenomenal design thrown in.'
- title: 'Data Visualization'
  description: 'Can the entire earth be captured into one single frame picture from space? It defies the science of optics and celestial photography. Therefore, the satellite takes a series of images, frames them together and makes one large gigantic picture so full of detail and richness. That’s largest of large photography. Now, what if we had a billion images like that to put together, or better still, hundreds and thousands of complicated data from your server farms to understand a simple equation and derive actionable insights? To steer this big data revolution forward, our team of technology engineers and design platform enthusiasts are making data visualization meet the challenges of tomorrow. It’s about recreating the beauty of digital future with top-notch presentation and to make the most complicated look enduring and everlasting.'
